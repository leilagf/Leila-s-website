                        <br>
                    This is my wesbite portfolio for year one uni assignment.
                    I am 19 years old doing a digital media degree. I moved from 
                    London to Bristol.  
                    
                    In this wesbite I have included some past work that i have 
                    created as well as the required tasks.

                    Coding task
                    
                <br>
                <a href=https://github.com/leilagf/HTML_CSS>Pizza and cake Repository.</a>
                <br>
                This task helped me understand the basic structure and coding of a 
                <br>
                it helped greatly in my final website project as it introduced me to 
                <br>
                adding images and the layout of a simpel website. I grasped the concept of 
                <br> 
                style sheets and how to make the website more professional.

                <br>
                <a href=https://github.com/leilagf/flexbox-rundown>Flexbox rundown Repository.</a>
                <br>
                In the flexbox-rundown coding task I got to explore and experiment how to create
                <br> 
                clear heading and buttons. There was an error in my code when changing li to Buttons
                <br>
                but once I got the hang of it I was able to create working buttons and style them.
                <br>
                also it makes it helped on how to make the website not break up when moving it
