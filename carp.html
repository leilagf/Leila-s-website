                       <h1>Main poster</h1>
                        <br>
                        In this poster i have included some Dilatational layout with the title 
                        around the logo, also there is some repetition with the logo as I placed a 
                        half on both sides. I went for a hue of turquoise for the background to create 
                        a contrast with the red but also it's not very distracting.I chose this as my
                        main poster because it's got a good layout and everything is clearly presented
                        for the viewer. Even though it is quite simple it makes it easy to get around 
                        and the viewer to navigate there eyes to the important information. There are no 
                        images because I did not go with the design I was going for.

                       <h2>Second poster</h2>
                        <br>
                        This poster is my most simple poster. Even though it is simple it has 
                        a intriguing background colour and all the information needed for the 
                        festival. I made the logo transparent with photoshop to contrast with 
                        the red bacground.The colour scheme i went for is red and black as they 
                        contrast but also go with the logo of the festival so it is identifiable. 
                        I used the font type Clarendon URW for the location and date. For the 
                        information about the festival I used two different fonts
                        (minion pro and Clarendon URW, medium)

                   <h2>Third poster</h2>
                    <br>
                    For this poster I tried to explore more with divsion and shapes. I added a red 
                    cut of rectangle to creatre contrast and division in the poster. I explored with
                    fonts and used a few different ones, skia, minion pro and chalkduster for the header.
                    The alignment is all pretty straight with a few things pushed left and right. I tilted
                    the heading to create some different between the heading and the rest fo the text.
