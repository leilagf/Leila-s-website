                       Third poster
                        <br>
                        This poster is my most simple poster. Even though it is simple it has 
                        a intriguing background colour and all the information needed for the 
                        festival. I made the logo transparent with photoshop to contrast with 
                        the red bacground.The colour scheme i went for is red and black as they 
                        contrast but also go with the logo of the festival so it is identifiable. 
                        I used the font type Clarendon URW for the location and date. For the 
                        information about the festival I used two different fonts
                        (minion pro and Clarendon URW, medium)

                       second poster
                        <br>
                        In this postter i have included some Dilatational layout with the title 
                        around the logo, also there is some repetition with the logo as I placed a 
                        half on both sides. I went for a 
                        hue of turquoise for the background to create a contrast with the red but 
                        also it's not very distracting.
