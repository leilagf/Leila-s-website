                       Third poster
                        <br>
                        This poster is my most simple poster. It does not have much to it and I 
                        used the content provided for me, however I do feel that even though it
                        is simple it has a intriguing background colour and all the information needed 
                        for the festival. The colour scheme i went for is bred and black as they contrast
                        but also go with the logo of the festival so it is identifiable.

                <div class="media-container">
                    
                        <img src="poster 2.png" width="430" height="570">

                       second poster
                        <br>
                        In this poster i have included I have used some Dilatational layout with 
                        the title, also there is some repetition with the logo. I wanted to create some
                        radial layout using the text and the logo as it can be used as a focal point.
                        Once again it is quite a basic poster but still has a aesthetic layout. 
                        I have experimented with the proximtiy of the logo. I went for more of a basic 
                        colour scheme for this poster
