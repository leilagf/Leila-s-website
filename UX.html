                    For my Stragedy and scope plan for my website,
                    I firstly thought about the users tht would 
                    potentially use my website. What functions would 
                    be appropriate for them.
                </p>
                <p> My first use which is the marker, Mary Jackson I had to 
                    make the website clear and usable that all my tasks
                    are clearly presented and understandable.I achieved this
                    by creating menu bar navigation that leads to a page for 
                    each of the tasks. However I left the coding task on the 
                    main page as it helped me majorly in creating my wesbite 
                    and was like a step one to making a final website.
                    I added a picture of myself and an about me aswell as 
                    a clip of a project I created. This is suitable for 
                    potential employers. They will not only see my skills of 
                    making a website but also a music video. As for users such 
                    as myself and friends and family, the whole wesbite 
                    shows my potential of creating a working site.
