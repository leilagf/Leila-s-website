                    For this assignment I had to make a website portfolio 
                    and 5 tasks included in it. This was my first time making 
                    a website using HTML, even though I came across a few struggles 
                    I have accomplished making a working website. Through-out this 
                    assignment I have also advanced my skills in Adobe InDesign and 
                    illustrator and photoshop on the side. Getting use them and 
                    Html will help me further in graphic and web design and other 
                    modules. It can also help me in the future looking for a career
                    in this field as I’ve gained basic skills that will expand. Even 
                    though I am just exploring these apps and how to use them, I added
                    in a clip of a music which I filmed, directed and edited on premier 
                    Pro to show I have strong skills within Digital media.  
                </p>
                <p> For my website I wanted to make it more intricate, but due to it being 
                    my first-time using Html and creating a website from scratch. The worksheet 
                    really guided me into the direction on how to make a start on it. I was unable
                    to do certain touches to my final website such as making my navigation bar a 
                    bit more aesthetic and make it dropdown, however I was able to confidently add 
                    media and make usable and smooth. I would like to be able to achieve these goals
                    in the future of making a less blocky website but I think for a first time I did 
                    reach my current goals overall.

                    <p>
                    The the user expererience tast gave me an accurate picture of how I wanted to execute
                    my tasks and website not only through knowing who my users are but also the flowcharts 
                    and wireframes I had a picture of to follow whenn deciding what layout I wanted when it 
                    came to inserting things into my Website instead of pondering over it when writing in the 
                    code. 
                    </p>

                    This project overall pushed me into using and researching various aspects of 
                    graphic and web design which I haven’t explored too much in the past. With the 
                    Carp task I had to individually find out how to use InDesign for example cutting 
                    shapes and wrapping text etc. even though we had been told a few things in lectures
                     I decided I wanted to find out a few more tools on there as well as illustrator they 
                     aren’t the same but once getting the hang of one it’s easier to use the other, I used 
                     photoshop to make some cut some things which made it easier, and I know a bit more about 
                     photoshop. I think I did accomplish using proximity, repetition, contrast and alignment 
                     in the posters. For the typography task I got a clearer understanding of each design and 
                     layout when making them myself. I feel both these task went hand in hand in some ways. 
                <p>

                    I think what I would differently next time would be spending a bit more time on the design of 
                    website. Maybe researching for codes that would help me with this as i used quit basic coding.
                    I thought more on the inputting everything that was required and making sure the links or pages 
                    weren't broken.
