                Troughout all my posters I used green and the font Clarendon URW

                        <br>
                        For this poster I had to create an axial design, this consits of all the
                        content being on an invisible line. I decide to tilt my contetn instead of 
                        having it all straight down as I think it draws more attention to it.
                        I added some shapes such as cirlces and rectangles to create a more 
                        interesting layout.

                        For this poster it was Bilateral desing. It is based on centering everything
                        and making it balanced. I try used some symmetry with the sqaures to create this 
                        balance. Once again I decided to put some of it at an angle, as having everything 
                        straight can look sort of boring.

                        I started of this poster by creating points for the  text to go around.
                        Instead of having blank spaces I added in cirlces.
                        I spent the most time on this one, playing aorund with the arc's and how to 
                        create a spiral.

                        This is classic design which is seen in everyday life,
                        Grid design is all very straight and blocky. All the text and content
                        are all fitted nicely into the boxes and creates a very structured
                        and neat look.

                        There are many ways to create a modular layout, I used circles to 
                        to show a repeating structure in the poster. I didn't type inside the circles
                        but used circle for information on the poster and clearly shows the information
                        needed for the viewer.

                        <br>
                        For radial layout everything has to be coming from or pointing onto one 
                        certain point. I've created three focal points, one large one for the titl
                        and the information that is needed first and two small ones.

                        For this poster I did a combination of all layouts to create a random layout.
                        With a few shapes and the text in different angles. Even though it is random
                        I feel that is it still quite aesthetic and clear to understand.

                        Personally this was the most confusing layout to design, having the waves
                        transitioning and flowing into eachother was pretty challening. I used lines to
                        show the movement of the text.
